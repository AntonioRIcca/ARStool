===== Optimal Power Flow (OPF) Tool - User Guide =====

    This tool runs an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) analysis with different network settings.

    üìå **Steps Conducted in the OPF Tool:**
    
    1Ô∏è‚É£ **Import Data**: Required data for networks and elements are loaded from a YML file.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ **Select Network**: User chooses a number (0-2) to indicate the network:
       - 0Ô∏è‚É£ = Underground network
       - 1Ô∏è‚É£ = EV parking lot
       - 2Ô∏è‚É£ = Residential area
    3Ô∏è‚É£ **Select Month**: User selects a month for the analysis.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ **Select Day**: User selects a day for the analysis.
    5Ô∏è‚É£ **Renewable Energy Prediction**: 
       - The tool predicts renewable power generation for the selected network.
       - It considers different external conditions: mean, high temperature, low solar, high wind, and low wind.
    6Ô∏è‚É£ **Run OPF for 96 Time Steps**:
       - Each time step represents a 15-minute interval (24 hours in total).
       - The output includes:
         ‚úÖ Power imported from the grid
         ‚úÖ Discharging power & charging power
         ‚úÖ Battery SoC (State of Charge)
         ‚úÖ Charging/discharging state (binary)
    7Ô∏è‚É£ **Islanding Operation Analysis**:
       - The tool evaluates the **resilience** of the selected network in islanded mode.
       - It calculates **reliability indices** to assess performance.

    üîπ Developed for power system optimization and resilience assessment.
